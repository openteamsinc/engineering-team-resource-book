# Communication Standards 

The way we communicate within our team affects every single aspect of our team. Unfortunately, it is very common to overlook or not think about whether or not we are communicating effectively with our colleagues, particularly when most of our communication takes written form, where we become insensitive to issues such as semantic satiation, gaps in our communication choices of wording or the information we convey. For this, we will like to work towards building better communication habits and practices as a team. 


Some of the things that each team member is responsible for include: 

- Communicate with your team members, team lead, manager, and project manager regularly and in a timely manner. 
- Provide feedback to your team leader if there are things that we, as a team, can improve upon or things that are impacting your productivity and/or wellbeing in a negative way, or any other feedback that you have about anything. 
- Share your knowledge and learning with your team, and help your teammates when they are stuck. 
- Do not be afraid to speak up and ask questions if anything is unclear or you have concerns that need addressing. 
- Team leaders and managers must communicate clear expectations and offer regular feedback to reinforce productive habits and admonishments when something is to be corrected for. 

## Using Slack Effectively 

Being a remote-first and global team (and organization) requires more granular practices of communication. Slack works as our office and thus, often necessitates additional attention to how we communicate. The following are just a few examples that we will adopt when using Slack to support our efforts to maximize effective communication as a team: 

- Respond to work-related questions you receive on Slack in a timely manner, as your team member(s) might be relying on the information you might be able to provide. This means you should make sure the team members are aware of any major changes to your work schedule. 
- You are allowed to take advantage of the flexible schedule OpenTeams lets you have. However, your Slack status needs to reflect if you are away running errands, when you expect to be back, if you will be offline for an extended period of time, or if you will be working during hours different than your normal schedule that day, etc. in a status note or through a message in the team channel to your team members on Slack, especially if you are a full time employee. If you are an intern or part time employee and you have informed your team about your general work schedule, you do not need to be as granular in your slack statuses. This helps everyone manage their expectations regarding getting a response to their questions from you, or a task to be completed in the expected time frame. 
- Be mindful of your team members’ time zones – if your message is time sensitive and you need to tag a colleague’s name, please use it judiciously. As a global company, we often work at different hours. 
- If you are taking time off, you should mark it on your work calendar as PTO. It is highly recommended that you integrate your OpenTeams calendar with Slack. This will allow Slack to see that you marked certain dates on your calendar as Out of Office and place the Out of Office Emoji next to your Slack name. If you do not want to integrate your calendar to your Slack for some reason, please place this emoji in your Slack status before you leave to let everyone know that you are taking time off. This adds a nonverbal but effective layer of communication for your team members. 
- If a team member has the (out of office emoji) next to their name, avoid tagging their name with `@`. They might have forgotten to pause their notifications. We want our colleagues to unplug when they are taking time off and not be notified unless it is absolutely necessary or an emergency. 
- Keep your OpenTeams calendar up to date with your PTO or any other commitments you have that will affect your work hours. 


## Agile Development: Sprints and Stand ups 

### Sprints

OpenTeams Engineering Team uses an Agile Development model where we hold biweekly Sprints. (See here to learn more about [Agile Sprints in Software Development](https://www.simplilearn.com/agile-sprint-article)). As a member of this team, you are expected to keep the Sprint board on Gitlab current *at all times* with the tasks you have defined, assigned to, actively working on, etc. and move them into their appropriate columns depending on where the task/issue is in its cycle (to do, doing, in review, close). This streamlines the dependencies of tasks and improves communication. Additionally, it provides transparency and visibility to our team’s progress while also providing a clear picture of where the overall sprint progress stands. 

### Stand Ups 

We have daily stand ups (currently Tuesday - Friday) where we briefly go over our status and any blockers we might have. These meetings are intended to be short and to the point. We do not need to go into the details of the issues we are working on, but briefly report what the tasks we will work on that day are, what we did yesterday, and if we have any problems that prevent us from making progress. If you need to discuss a certain issue or problem with one or more team members, you can do so by either staying longer at the stand up call after the stand up ends, or setting up a different time to meet them. 

Everyone is expected to attend all the stand up meetings. However, things come up and you might need to miss a meeting. Please post your status on the **#engineering-team** channel if you need to miss the stand up on a given day.
