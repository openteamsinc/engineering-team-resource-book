# Monitoring GCP Slack Alerts 

GCP has a built in monitoring service for projects deployed on GCP.  This section describes the process of setting up these alerts to link with Slack and email and message a private channel when a specific condition is met. For this, you need to be an admin or owner of the Slack workspace that you want to be notified in, and you need to have one of the following roles in the project you wish to set up alerts for: Monitoring Notification, Channel Editor, Monitoring Editor, Monitoring Admin, Project Editor, or Project Owner. You can check your role by going to the welcome page for the project, clicking IAM & Admin below and then looking in the permissions table for your email and role.
