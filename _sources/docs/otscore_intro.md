# OpenTeams Score

OpenTeams Score is a scoring algorithm that assigns a score to all open source projects we are indexing.  The score is a weighted average of the 6 components defined {ref}`here<../docs/otscore_components.md>`. The score is intended to provide a consistent and transparent measure that can potential guide a business user in choosing OSS packages that best fit their project goals.

V.1 of the project takes into account only 4 of these components as a proof of concept and development will continue as we improve the project in V.2, which we are currently working on. The second version includes the governance and versioning components that the first version does not.

:::{admonition} Goal
Calculating a “OpenTeams score” for a given open source project environment that aims to eventually become an industry standard developed by OpenTeams.
